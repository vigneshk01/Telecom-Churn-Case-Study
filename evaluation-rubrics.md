| Data understanding, preparation, and<br />feature engineering  (35%)          | All important data quality checks are performed and<br />inconsistent/missing data is handled appropriately.<br />Relevant EDA is done using plots and summaries. <br />The insights from EDA are clearly derived and explained. <br /> Filtering high-value customers and tagging churned <br />customers is done correctly. <br /> Feature engineering is conducted rigorously and correctly. <br /> An appropriate set of features is used to build the model.                                                                                                                                     | Data quality checks are not performed/missing data <br />is not handled correctly.<br />Exploratory analysis is not conducted/useful observations <br />are either not extracted or mentioned clearly.<br />Filtering high-value customers or tagging is done incorrectly.<br />Feature engineering is not conducted or is conducted on <br />an inappropriate set of features.                                                                                |
| Modelling (churn prediction) (35%)                                            | Dimensionality reduction is conducted correctly, including<br />data preparation required for it.<br />Class imbalance is handled using at least one of the techniques. <br />Model hyperparameters are tuned using correct principles <br />and the approach is explained clearly.<br /> A reasonable number and variety of different models are <br />attempted and the best one is chosen based on <br />key performance metrics.<br /> Model evaluation is conducted using an appropriate metric. <br />Model evaluation results are at par with the best possible<br /> models on this data set. | Dimensionality reduction is not conducted correctly/data <br />is not preprocessed.<br />Class imbalance is not handled.<br /> Model hyperparameters are not tuned correctly or the <br />approach is not explained clearly. <br />Few models are experimented with resulting in suboptimal results. <br />Model evaluation is not conducted using an appropriate metric. <br />The results are suboptimal compared to what is possible <br />on this dataset. |
| Identifying important churn indicators and<br />business recommendation (20%) | Important churn indicators are identified correctly.<br />Clear actionable recommendations are provided based <br />on supporting evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Important indicators are not identified correctly.<br />Recommendations are unclear, unactionable or not backed <br />with supporting evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
